OVERVIEW:
This project contains the following files:
1. LinearHash.cpp – this file defines the behaviour of each function within the ‘linearprob’ class. It also contains the main driver functions which prints to the standard output, takes input from any file and executes the functions accordingly.
2. header.h – this file defines the data structures and functions present within the ‘linearprob’ class.
3. ChainingHash.cpp- this file defines the behaviour of each function within the ‘chaining’ class. It also contains the main driver functions which prints to the standard output, takes input from any file and executes the functions accordingly.
4. Header_unordered.h- this file defines the behaviour of each function within the ‘chaining’ class


PURPOSE: Execute Open,Linear Hashing and Unordered, Chaining Hashing Tables
